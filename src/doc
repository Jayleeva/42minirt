Scenario: The dot product of two tuples
Given a ← vector(1, 2, 3)
And b ← vector(2, 3, 4)
Then dot(a, b) = 20
Given those two vectors, the dot product is computed as the sum of the
products of the corresponding components of each vector. Here’s pseudocode
showing what that looks like:
function dot(a, b)
return a.x * b.x +
a.y * b.y +
a.z * b.z +
a.w * b.w
end function

the smaller the dot product, the larger the angle between the vectors. For
example, given two unit vectors, a dot product of 1 means the vectors are
identical, and a dot product of -1 means they point in opposite directions.
More specifically, and again if the two vectors are unit vectors, the dot product
is actually the cosine of the angle between them
